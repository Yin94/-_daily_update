The measure of how fast the page load is the time it need to load the initial view(before the scroll)
    The main idea is to remove or reduce calls in critical render path that are not needed for the initial view.(above the fold content shr)
Only three ways to optimize the critical render path:

    1.Minimize the number of critical resources. => Less files=> less traffic.(http protocol file number limit)
    2.Minimize the number of critical bytes.=> Less download and load time. (including image size)
    3.Minimize the critical path length. => less steps for first seen view
        Javascript: only first view js load, else defer
        Css: same. get rid of unneeded css and use inline style
        images: same, load only needed for 1st view, else defer. Plus responsive image.
